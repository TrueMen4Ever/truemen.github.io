      <p>
        A <strong>“true man”</strong> nurtures mind, body, and spirit, guided by virtues such as courage, generosity, and responsible leadership. True manhood emphasizes accountability and care for others, rather than entitlement or privilege—reflecting the principle that “men are protectors and maintainers of women” (Qur’an 4:34). Courage, generosity, and competent guidance are essential traits, as noted in prophetic teachings: “A man should not be stingy, cowardly, or incapable of leading” (Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 2850). Leadership, therefore, is less about authority and more about service—toward family, community, and society—rooted in ethical and spiritual cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Courage should be exercised in the pursuit of justice, generosity directed toward the well-being of others, and leadership tempered by humility (Al-Ghazali, <em>Ihya’ Ulum al-Din</em>). Contemporary scholarship echoes this holistic ideal: authentic manhood combines self-mastery with meaningful contribution to society (Connell, 2005). Ultimately, a true man is defined not by status or dominance, but by consistently embodying virtues that uplift both self and community.
      </p>
    
      <p><strong>The Filter of True Men:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Courage:</strong> Facing challenges, protecting the vulnerable, and standing for justice.</li>
        <li><strong>Generosity:</strong> Sharing resources, time, and knowledge for the benefit of others.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsible Leadership:</strong> Guiding with integrity, humility, and accountability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additional qualities such as self-mastery, compassion, and ethical integrity support and reinforce these core traits, shaping a holistic and authentic manhood.

          <p>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), regarded as the final messenger in Islam, is widely recognized as the
            seal of
            prophethood and a paragon of moral and spiritual excellence (Esposito, 2011). Born in Mecca in 570 CE, he
            was orphaned
            at a young age and raised under challenging social conditions in a society marked by tribal conflict and
            moral decline
            (Ibn Ishaq, 1955/1974). Even prior to the reception of revelation, he was known as Al-Amin, “the
            Trustworthy,” due to
            his reputation for honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct (Lings, 1983). At the age of 40, he received the
            first
            revelation, beginning a prophetic mission that he pursued despite significant social, economic, and personal
            hardships.
            He faced ridicule, persecution, and loss, yet remained steadfast in his commitment to monotheism and the
            ethical reform
            of society (Rahman, 1979).</p>

          <p>Muhammad’s life exemplifies a balance of mercy, firmness, and ethical leadership. As a military leader, he
            demonstrated
            strategic acumen and courage, but his actions were consistently tempered by principles of justice and
            proportionality
            (Ibn Hisham, 1955/1997). In his domestic life, he exhibited compassion, humility, and attentiveness to his
            family,
            engaging in household duties and treating his wives with respect and equity (Ali, 2006). Socially, he
            maintained strong
            interpersonal bonds: he remembered the names of his companions, visited the sick, supported the vulnerable,
            and honored
            the elderly (Lings, 1983). As a political and community leader, he governed with transparency, forgiveness,
            and service,
            prioritizing the welfare of the ummah over personal power (Esposito, 2011). His spiritual devotion was
            characterized
            by nightly prayers, supplication, and intercession for the broader community, reflecting his deep empathy
            and moral
            responsibility.</p>

          <p>The prophetic model demonstrates moderation, ethical consistency, and spiritual guidance, emphasizing
            practical and
            timeless principles applicable across contexts. Muhammad’s example provides a framework for moral
            excellence, social
            justice, and spiritual cultivation, serving as a paradigm for individuals striving for integrity, humility,
            and resilience
            in both personal and societal spheres (Rahman, 1979; Lings, 1983). His legacy continues to inform
            contemporary discussions
            on ethics, leadership, and religious practice, highlighting the enduring relevance of his teachings.</p>

          <p>Jesus (ʿĪsā), recognized as one of the most revered prophets in Islam, is understood as a divinely
            appointed messenger
            who conveyed God’s guidance to humanity. According to Islamic sources, he was born miraculously to the
            Virgin Maryam
            without a father, a sign of God’s omnipotence and mercy (Qur’an 3:45–47; 19:16–22). From birth, his life was
            marked
            by divine favor: as an infant, he spoke in defense of his mother, proclaiming himself as a devoted servant
            of God
            (Esposito, 2011). Throughout his prophetic mission, he performed numerous miracles—including healing the
            blind and
            lepers, raising the dead, and giving life to clay birds—by God’s permission, all as signs intended to guide
            people
            toward monotheism and moral rectitude (Qur’an 5:110).</p>

          <p>Jesus’ life exemplified asceticism, humility, and moral integrity. He led a life detached from worldly
            wealth, political
            power, and material possessions, traveling from town to town to preach love, repentance, and submission to
            God’s will
            (Rahman, 1979). He emphasized ethical conduct, compassion, and sincere worship, confronting corrupt
            authorities
            and advocating for justice and humility. His actions—including serving others, showing empathy for the
            afflicted,
            and forgiving those who opposed him—reflect an integration of spiritual devotion and ethical practice (Nasr,
            2003;
            Esposito, 2011).</p>

          <p>In Islamic theology, ʿĪsā is not considered the son of God but a mighty messenger and a pure creation of
            God’s word
            and spirit (Qur’an 4:171). He was not crucified but was raised up by God and will return before the end of
            time to
            restore justice and truth (Qur’an 4:157–159). His legacy embodies spiritual surrender, moral courage, and
            humility,
            providing a model for ethical living that prioritizes divine obedience over worldly dominance and pride.
            Through his
            example, ʿĪsā demonstrates that true greatness is found in submission to God and in service to humanity
            (Lings, 1983).</p>

        <div class="modal-body">
          <p>Moses (Mūsā in Arabic) is among the most frequently mentioned prophets in the Qur’an, and his life
            exemplifies trials,
            spiritual transformation, and unwavering trust in God (Esposito, 2011). Born during a period when Pharaoh
            ordered the
            execution of all newborn Israelite boys, Mūsā’s early life was marked by danger. By divine intervention, he
            was
            safely raised in Pharaoh’s palace, receiving an upbringing that later equipped him to confront tyranny and
            lead his
            people (Ibn Kathir, 2003). Following an accidental killing, Mūsā fled into exile, where he spent years in
            solitude
            and reflection, culminating in his divine encounter at the burning bush—a pivotal moment that signaled the
            beginning
            of his prophetic mission (Qur’an 20:9–24).</p>

          <p>Despite his stutter and humble background as a shepherd, Mūsā returned to Pharaoh armed not with armies but
            with
            divine signs, commanding, “Let my people go” (Qur’an 7:104–105). His courage was grounded in absolute
            reliance on God
            rather than personal ambition. He endured rejection by his own community, humiliation from Pharaoh’s court,
            and carried
            out numerous miracles by God’s permission, including the parting of the sea, which facilitated the
            Israelites’ escape
            and the drowning of Pharaoh (Qur’an 26:63–66). These events highlight Mūsā’s role as both a spiritual and
            political
            leader, exemplifying steadfastness, faith, and divine guidance in the face of oppression.</p>

          <p>Mūsā’s mission continued long after these dramatic events. He spent decades guiding a people often
            resistant to
            instruction, demonstrating patience, persistence, and moral leadership. His prolonged fasts, including the
            40 nights
            on Mount Sinai to receive revelation, and his intense yearning to witness God, reflect his deep spiritual
            commitment
            (Qur’an 7:142–143). Mūsā’s life illustrates that true leadership emphasizes service over dominance,
            persistence over
            perfection, and the conquest of internal doubt alongside external challenges. His example provides enduring
            lessons in
            faith, resilience, and ethical responsibility (Nasr, 2003; Rahman, 1979).</p>

          <p>Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham in the Judeo-Christian tradition) is one of the most revered patriarchs in Islam,
            celebrated for his unwavering faith, rational inquiry, and total submission to God’s will (Esposito, 2011).
            From
            an early age, he challenged the idolatry and false practices of his people, even confronting his own father
            in defense
            of monotheism (Qur’an 6:74–79). His intellectual and spiritual inquiry led him to reject the worship of
            celestial
            bodies—the stars, moon, and sun—ultimately affirming exclusive devotion to the Creator of all existence
            (Nasr, 2003).
            Ibrahim’s narrative exemplifies courage, reasoning, and moral steadfastness in the pursuit of divine truth.
          </p>

          <p>Throughout his life, Ibrahim faced extreme trials that tested his faith and obedience. When cast into a
            blazing fire
            for rejecting idolatry, God protected him, rendering the fire harmless (Qur’an 21:69). He undertook arduous
            migrations
            at God’s command, leaving behind comfort and security. Notably, he obeyed divine instructions to leave his
            wife Hajar
            and infant son Ismail in the barren desert of Makkah, and he demonstrated complete submission when commanded
            in a
            vision to sacrifice his son, an act halted by divine mercy (Qur’an 37:100–111). These episodes reflect not
            blind
            faith, but conscious surrender rooted in trust, devotion, and moral conviction (Rahman, 1979).</p>

          <p>Ibrahim’s title, Khalīlullāh—Friend of God—reflects his exceptional closeness to the Divine. His legacy
            endures
            in Islamic ritual, including the rites of Hajj, the establishment of the Kaaba, and the call to prayer,
            serving as
            a model for pious conduct and moral integrity (Esposito, 2011). His life demonstrates that true faith
            integrates
            reason, obedience, and sacrifice, providing a timeless paradigm for spiritual, ethical, and personal
            development.</p>

          <p>Prophet Nūḥ (Noah) is recognized in the Qur’an as a model of resilience, perseverance, and unwavering
            commitment to
            divine truth (Esposito, 2011). Sent to a people entrenched in idolatry and moral corruption, he preached the
            message of
            monotheism for an extraordinary period of 950 years, calling both publicly and privately for repentance and
            return
            to God (Qur’an 29:14; 71:1–28). Despite his persistent efforts, only a few accepted his guidance. He endured
            ridicule,
            mockery, and social ostracism, yet remained steadfast in his mission, driven by sincere concern for his
            community rather
            than personal recognition (Nasr, 2003).</p>

          <p>Nūḥ’s life exemplifies patient obedience and moral fortitude. Following God’s command, he constructed the
            ark,
            laboring amid the laughter and derision of his people (Qur’an 11:36–40). His absolute trust in God was
            rewarded when
            the flood came, delivering divine justice to the corrupt while preserving the righteous. His deep emotional
            connection
            is illustrated in his grief over his son, who disbelieved and perished, highlighting the personal cost of
            prophetic
            responsibility and the tension between mission and familial attachment (Rahman, 1979).</p>

          <p>The legacy of Nūḥ underscores the principles of perseverance, ethical steadfastness, and moral courage. His
            story teaches
            that truth is not validated by popularity, and sincere commitment is measured by sacrifice and dedication to
            principle.
            For those striving to uphold values in the face of societal opposition, Nūḥ provides a paradigm of patient
            endurance,
            faithful action, and unwavering adherence to divine guidance (Esposito, 2011; Nasr, 2003).</p>

          <p>Imam Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal (780–855 CE) stands as a central figure in Islamic scholarship, renowned for his
            steadfast
            commitment to orthodoxy and ethical integrity during a period of significant political and theological
            turmoil (Robinson, 2001).
            Living under the Abbasid Caliphate, he became a prominent symbol of intellectual resistance during the Mihna
            (inquisition),
            when scholars were pressured to endorse the doctrine that the Qur’an was created. Imam Aḥmad’s refusal,
            despite imprisonment,
            beating, and torture, upheld the traditional Sunni belief in the Qur’an’s uncreated, eternal nature,
            demonstrating his
            unwavering devotion to God over personal safety (Hallaq, 1984).</p>

          <p>Beyond his theological courage, Imam Aḥmad made monumental contributions to hadith studies, memorizing vast
            numbers of
            traditions and compiling the <em>Musnad</em>, one of the most comprehensive collections of prophetic
            narrations (Brown, 2009).
            His life combined rigorous scholarship with ethical practice: he taught discreetly under oppressive
            conditions, supported the
            needy, forgave his detractors, and engaged in prolonged nightly worship. His humility, patience, and moral
            courage exemplify
            the integration of knowledge and ethical action in Islamic leadership, showing that true strength lies in
            adherence to divine
            principles rather than worldly power or recognition (Robinson, 2001; Hallaq, 1984).</p>

          <p>Imam Aḥmad’s legacy continues to inspire Islamic scholarship and moral fortitude, demonstrating that
            scholarly excellence
            and ethical resilience are mutually reinforcing. His example underscores the importance of maintaining
            integrity, moral courage,
            and submission to God in the face of social, political, or intellectual pressure.</p>

          <p>Imam al-Shāfi‘ī (767–820 CE) is recognized as a foundational figure in Islamic jurisprudence, celebrated
            for his
            intellectual rigor, eloquence, and systematic approach to legal theory. He synthesized principles from the
            Qur’an,
            Sunnah, consensus (ijmā‘), and analogical reasoning (qiyās), laying the groundwork for the development of
            the Shāfi‘ī
            school of law (Hallaq, 2005). His sharp memory, mastery of debate, and poetic eloquence contributed to his
            reputation
            as both a scholar and a jurist of exceptional clarity, earning respect from contemporaries and critics alike
            (Makdisi, 1981).</p>

          <p>Despite extensive travels and studies under prominent scholars of his time, Imam al-Shāfi‘ī maintained
            humility and
            devotion to learning. He emphasized adherence to the Sunnah and the Qur’an while remaining open to reasoned
            interpretation,
            stressing that the pursuit of truth should take precedence over personal gain or recognition (Hallaq, 2005).
            His guiding
            principle, "If I speak the truth, follow me; if my companions speak the truth, follow them," reflects his
            commitment to
            intellectual honesty, communal consultation, and ethical scholarship (Makdisi, 1981). Through his work, Imam
            al-Shāfi‘ī
            shaped the methodology of Islamic law, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to influence legal and
            ethical thought
            in Muslim societies.</p>

          <p>Imam Abū Ḥanīfa (699–767 CE) is recognized as a pioneering figure in Islamic jurisprudence, notable for
            integrating
            rational inquiry with strict adherence to divine revelation. As both a successful merchant and an
            independent scholar,
            he supported students of knowledge and developed the foundations of the Ḥanafī school, which became the most
            widely
            followed legal tradition in the Muslim world (Hallaq, 2005). His legal acumen was matched by his ethical
            integrity;
            he refused to endorse political appointments he considered unjust, resulting in imprisonment and corporal
            punishment,
            demonstrating his unwavering commitment to principle over personal safety (Makdisi, 1981).</p>

          <p>Imam Abū Ḥanīfa taught thousands of students, emphasizing critical reasoning, reflection, and principled
            action.
            He advocated a jurisprudence that combined intellect with piety, asserting that Islamic law is not merely a
            codification
            of rules but a framework for lived ethics encompassing mercy, justice, and moral responsibility (Hallaq,
            2005).
            Through his teachings, Abū Ḥanīfa established not only a legal school but also a culture of ethical
            conscience,
            shaping generations of scholars and the broader development of Islamic legal thought.</p>

          <p>Imam Mālik ibn Anas (711–795 CE) is recognized as one of the foremost jurists of early Islam, particularly
            associated
            with the city of Madinah, the Prophet’s (ﷺ) city of guidance. He is renowned for his reverence for Hadith,
            meticulous
            methodology, and ethical rigor, culminating in the compilation of the <em>Muwatta</em>, the earliest
            systematic collection
            of Islamic law and prophetic tradition (Hallaq, 2005). Imam Mālik maintained independence from political
            authority,
            refusing to allow rulers to manipulate religious rulings for political ends, an integrity that at times
            subjected him
            to public flogging and social pressure (Makdisi, 1981).</p>

          <p>Imam Mālik exemplified the integration of personal piety, scholarly discipline, and ethical conduct. He
            emphasized
            that true knowledge is not merely the accumulation of reports but a divine illumination placed in the heart
            by God,
            and he refused to transmit Hadith unless in a state of ritual purity (wudu) (Brown, 2009). His composure,
            careful speech,
            and moral consistency illustrate a life in which scholarly excellence was inseparable from spiritual and
            ethical integrity,
            providing a model of calm, rooted, and radiant scholarship for subsequent generations of Muslim jurists and
            students.</p>

          <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov (b. 1988) is widely recognized not only as a dominant figure in mixed martial arts
            (MMA) but also
            as a model of discipline, humility, and faith in professional sports (Sherdog, 2020). Raised in the
            mountainous region
            of Dagestan, Russia, Khabib’s upbringing was shaped by a rigorous regimen of physical training and moral
            education under
            the guidance of his father, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, a prominent wrestling coach. His approach combined
            technical mastery
            with personal development, emphasizing self-discipline and ethical conduct alongside athletic achievement
            (O’Reilly, 2021).</p>

          <p>Throughout his professional career, Khabib remained undefeated, a rare accomplishment in the high-stakes
            world of
            MMA. His success was accompanied by a consistent demonstration of personal values: humility in victory,
            restraint in
            conflict, and respect toward opponents, coaches, and family members. He has frequently highlighted the role
            of faith,
            parental respect, and moral responsibility in his life, articulating a philosophy in which true strength is
            inseparable
            from ethical conduct and spiritual commitment (Sherdog, 2020; O’Reilly, 2021).</p>

          <p>Khabib’s example illustrates a broader conception of masculinity and leadership in sports, one that
            privileges self-control,
            loyalty, and ethical integrity over aggression or notoriety. In a cultural environment often dominated by
            spectacle and
            ego, he demonstrates that personal excellence and adherence to moral and spiritual principles can coexist
            with global fame
            and competitive dominance.</p>

          <p>Malcolm X (1925–1965) emerged as a transformative figure in the struggle for racial justice and civil
            rights in the
            United States. His early life, marked by familial disruption, systemic oppression, and incarceration, shaped
            a profound
            understanding of social injustice and personal resilience (Marable, 2011). As a spokesperson for the Nation
            of Islam, he
            articulated the dignity of Black Americans and the necessity of confronting racial inequities with
            principled courage,
            emphasizing self-respect, accountability, and empowerment (Glaude, 2016).</p>

          <p>Malcolm’s intellectual and spiritual evolution deepened following his pilgrimage (Hajj) to Mecca, where he
            experienced
            the universality of Islam and the ethical imperatives of justice, mercy, and unity (X, 1965). This
            experience catalyzed
            his transition from a militant activist to a more inclusive da‘i, advocating human rights and emphasizing
            ethical action
            grounded in the Qur’an and Sunnah. His well-known statement, "I am for truth, no matter who tells it. I’m
            for justice,
            no matter who it’s for or against," encapsulates his commitment to universal principles over partisan
            allegiance (X, 1965;
            Marable, 2011).</p>

          <p>Malcolm X’s life exemplifies a dynamic conception of masculinity, characterized by personal growth, ethical
            integrity,
            and the courage to confront both internal and societal challenges. His enduring legacy underscores the
            importance of moral
            conviction, intellectual rigor, and spiritual alignment in fostering leadership and social responsibility

          <p>Muhammad Ali (1942–2016) was not only a preeminent figure in professional boxing but also a prominent
            cultural,
            social, and religious icon. Beyond his athletic prowess, Ali embodied the integration of faith, ethics, and
            activism
            in public life (Hauser, 1991). He famously refused induction into the U.S. military during the Vietnam War,
            citing
            religious convictions and conscientious objection, a decision that led to legal challenges and the temporary
            stripping
            of his boxing titles (Roberts, 2004).</p>

          <p>Ali’s commitment to social justice extended beyond legal resistance. He actively advocated for civil
            rights, racial
            equality, and community empowerment, demonstrating moral courage in the face of widespread public criticism
            and
            financial penalties (Hauser, 1991; Roberts, 2004). His adherence to Islam and principled stance informed
            both his
            public persona and personal conduct, reinforcing the interplay between spiritual discipline and ethical
            leadership.
            Even as Parkinson’s disease gradually affected his physical abilities, Ali’s dedication to charitable work,
            prayer,
            and mentorship reflected a deepening of spiritual and moral resilience (Hauser, 1991).</p>

          <p>Muhammad Ali’s life exemplifies a conception of masculinity that merges physical courage with ethical
            integrity,
            spiritual devotion, and social responsibility. His legacy underscores that true greatness lies not merely in
            athletic
            achievement, but in principled action, moral leadership, and steadfast commitment to one’s beliefs (Roberts,
            2004).</p>

          <p>Alexander III of Macedon (356–323 BCE), commonly known as Alexander the Great, remains one of history’s
            most
            influential military leaders and strategists. Ascending the throne of Macedon at the age of 20, he embarked
            on a
            decade-long campaign that created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to
            Egypt
            and into northwest India (Green, 1991). His military genius lay in combining innovative tactics, disciplined
            organization,
            and psychological insight to achieve battlefield supremacy.</p>

          <p>Beyond his martial accomplishments, Alexander sought to integrate diverse cultures within his empire,
            promoting
            Hellenistic ideals while adopting elements of local governance and customs (Cartledge, 2004). He encouraged
            cultural
            exchange, founded cities such as Alexandria in Egypt, and patronized arts and sciences, leaving a lasting
            legacy
            on the intellectual and social fabric of the regions he conquered. His leadership style combined charisma,
            strategic
            vision, and personal bravery, although historical accounts also note instances of ruthlessness and
            authoritarianism
            (Green, 1991).</p>

          <p>Alexander’s life exemplifies the interplay between ambition, leadership, and cultural influence. While his
            conquests
            demonstrate the potential of disciplined strategy and audacity, his efforts to blend cultures underscore the
            importance
            of vision and adaptability in leadership. His legacy continues to be studied for its military, political,
            and cultural
            significance across multiple disciplines (Cartledge, 2004).</p>

          <p>Maryam (Mary), the mother of Isa (Jesus), occupies a central position in Islamic theology as a paradigm of
            piety,
            devotion, and divine selection. The Qur’an emphasizes her unique status among women, describing her as
            chosen and
            purified by Allah, and highlights her unwavering faith in the face of extraordinary trials (Qur’an 3:42–47;
            19:16–26)
            (Safi, 2018). From an early age, Maryam dedicated herself to worship and spiritual discipline within the
            sanctuary,
            reflecting a life centered on devotion and moral integrity.</p>

          <p>Her narrative encompasses the challenges of miraculous conception, societal scrutiny, and personal
            solitude.
            When informed of her role in giving birth to Isa, Maryam responded with steadfast submission and trust in
            God,
            exemplifying resilience and ethical fortitude (Qur’an 19:23–26) (Nasr, 2003). The Qur’an portrays her
            calmness
            and dignity in addressing her community, allowing Isa to speak on her behalf, highlighting her exceptional
            spiritual
            strength and reliance on divine guidance (Safi, 2018).</p>

          <p>Maryam’s life exemplifies the Islamic conception of honor and strength, demonstrating that true greatness
            derives
            from moral and spiritual excellence rather than worldly status. Her story remains a timeless model for women
            and
            men alike, illustrating the virtues of patience, purity, and absolute trust in God (Nasr, 2003).</p>
